      <dir><i>The Fedora Access service defines an open interface for
            		    accessing digital objects.  The access operations include methods to do
            		    reflection on a digital object (i.e., to discover the kinds of
            		    disseminations that are available on the object), and to request
            		    disseminations.  The major function of the Fedora Access service is 
            		    to fulfill a client's request for dissemination.  To support disseminations,
            		    the underlying repository system must evaluate the behavior associations
            		    specified in a digital object, and figure out how to dispatch a service
            		    request to a supporting service with which the digital object associates.
            		    The supporting service may be internal to the repository system, or it may
            		    be an external web service that the repository must call upon.  The
            		    underlying repostitory system facilitates all external service bindings
            		    on behalf of the client, simply returning a dissemination result via the
            		    Access service layer.

      <dir><i>  This is a simple URI-oriented service definition for the Access service 
            			of a Fedora repository.  It is intended to support a REST-like style of access to the 
            			Fedora Access web service (in contrast to a traditional SOAP web service definition).  
            			This means that we define a simple URL syntax that can be used to issue service requests.
            			API-A-Lite does not provide service bindings for all of the operations defined in Fedora's full
            			Access service (API-A).  API-A-Lite only provides bindings for getDissemination, getObjectProfile,
                       findObjects, and resumeFindObjects. 
            			The result of the getDissemination request is a MIME-typed stream.  The result of the getObjectProfile 
            			request is either HTML or XML, whichever the client requested.  The result of the search methods
                       is also either HTML or XML.  When URL syntax is shown below, green indicates required parts and red indicates optional
            parts.

      <dir><i>The Fedora Management service defines an open interface for
                administering the repository, including creating, modifying, and deleting
                digital objects, or components within digital objects.  The Management
                service interacts with the underlying repository system to read content from
                and write content to the digital object and datastream storage areas.  The
                Management service exposes a set of operations that enable a client to view
                and manipulate digital objects from an abstract perspective, meaning that
                a client does not need to know anything about underlying storage formats,
                storage media, or storage management schemes for objects.  Also, the
                underlying repository system handles the details of storing datastream
                content within the repository, as well as mediating connectivity for
                datastreams that reference external content.</i></dir>
